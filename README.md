## Check your understanding q's (FILL OUT)
1. In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Bujo project development pipeline? (just write the letter)

1

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

I would not use unit tests to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because there are much more intricacy in a two person interaction which is just to difficult of its replication. Unit tests do not have this intent.

3. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters

Yes, such test would entail utilizing a unit test, to utilize in order to see the behavior of the program when inputting more than 80 characters. Such feature does not work with other parts of the application and therefore a unit test will be adequate in this case.

4. What do you expect to happen if we run our puppeteer tests with the field “headless” set to true?

5. What would your beforeAll callback look like if you wanted to start from the settings page before every test case?
